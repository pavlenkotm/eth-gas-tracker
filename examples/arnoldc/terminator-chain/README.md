## 🎯 IT'S SHOWTIME (Overview)

**ArnoldC** is an esoteric programming language where **every keyword is a quote from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies**! Created by Lauri Hartikka in 2014, it turns programming into an action-packed Arnold movie. Perfect for demonstrating that blockchain development can be as epic as Terminator!

## 📚 LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION (THE RULES)

### Program Structure

```arnoldc
IT'S SHOWTIME              (Start program - main function)
  ... your code here ...
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED   (End program)
```

### Variable Declaration

```arnoldc
HEY CHRISTMAS TREE variableName    (Declare variable)
YOU SET US UP 42                   (Initialize with value)
```

### Assignment

```arnoldc
GET TO THE CHOPPER result          (Start assignment to 'result')
HERE IS MY INVITATION 5            (Load value 5)
GET UP 3                           (Add 3)
ENOUGH TALK                        (End assignment)
```

### Arithmetic Operations

| Command | Operation | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `GET UP` | Add | `GET UP 5` |
| `GET DOWN` | Subtract | `GET DOWN 3` |
| `YOU'RE FIRED` | Multiply | `YOU'RE FIRED 2` |
| `HE HAD TO SPLIT` | Divide | `HE HAD TO SPLIT 4` |
| `I LET HIM GO` | Modulo | `I LET HIM GO 10` |

### Comparison

| Command | Operation | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `LET OFF SOME STEAM BENNET` | Greater than | `LET OFF SOME STEAM BENNET 10` |
| `YOU ARE NOT YOU YOU ARE ME` | Equal | `YOU ARE NOT YOU YOU ARE ME 5` |
| `CONSIDER THAT A DIVORCE` | Or | Boolean OR |
| `KNOCK KNOCK` | And | Boolean AND |

### Output

```arnoldc
TALK TO THE HAND "Hello World"     (Print string)
TALK TO THE HAND variableName      (Print variable)
```

### Conditionals

```arnoldc
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SAY PLEASE condition
  (code if true)
BULLSHIT
  (code if false)
YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR LOGIC
```

### Loops

```arnoldc
STICK AROUND condition             (While loop)
  (loop body)
CHILL
```

### Functions

```arnoldc
LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY functionName    (Declare function)
I NEED YOUR CLOTHES YOUR BOOTS AND YOUR MOTORCYCLE paramName
  (function body)
I'LL BE BACK returnValue                    (Return)
HASTA LA VISTA, BABY                        (End function)
```

### Function Call

```arnoldc
DO IT NOW functionName              (Call function with no args)
GET YOUR ASS TO MARS functionName  (Call function with args)
```

## 🚀 EXAMPLES (GET TO THE CODE!)

### 1. Hello Blockchain (`hello_blockchain.arnoldc`)

```arnoldc
IT'S SHOWTIME
TALK TO THE HAND "I'LL BE BACK... WITH BLOCKCHAIN!"
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED
```

**Output:**

```

**Translation:**
- `IT'S SHOWTIME` = Start program (main function)
- `TALK TO THE HAND` = Print statement
- `YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED` = End program

HEY CHRISTMAS TREE totalGas
YOU SET US UP 0

GET TO THE CHOPPER totalGas
HERE IS MY INVITATION baseFee
GET UP priority
ENOUGH TALK

TALK TO THE HAND "Total Gas: 32 gwei"
TALK TO THE HAND "HASTA LA VISTA, BABY!"
